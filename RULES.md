MogriChess is similar to traditional chess. The biggest difference is that when one piece captures another in MogriChess, the capturing piece adds the movement capabilities of the captured piece.

### Pieces
- The king is identifed by the small inner circle that's in the opponent's color
- Movement ability is displayed by the symbols surrounding the piece's main circle (in the eight possible directions)
  -  No symbol = no movement ability in that direction
  -  One circle = can move on square in that direction
  -  Two circles = can move one or two squares in that direction
  -  Rectangle = can move one to infinite squares in that direction

### Basic rules
- Light player moves first
- When a piece captures another piece, the capturing piece adds the movement capabilities of the captured piece
  - For each direction, the capturing pieces ends up with the maximum movement capability between itself and the captured piece
- If a pawn reaches its opponent's back rank, it adds the ability to move one square in any direction
  - If it can already move two, or infinite, squares in that direction, it retains the larger movement capability
- Kings do not gain any additional movement capabilities if they capture a piece
- If a player's king is in check, their next move must get the king out of check
- Checkmate wins/ends the game

### Differences from traditional chess
- Pieces cannot "jump" over pieces (like a knight does in traditional chess)
- Pawns do not have the option to move two squares forward on their first move
- There is no *en passant* move
- There is no castling
