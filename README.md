# MogriChess

A chess-like game where capturing pieces gain the movement abilities of the pieces they capture.

The name comes from the "Calvin and Hobbes" comics. Calvin had a [Transmogrifier](https://calvinandhobbes.fandom.com/wiki/Transmogrifier) that could turn one thing into something else.

Screenshot of the game. Selected piece to move has a blue square, valid destinations for that piece have green squares.
